## Project Outline:
This application is a database that stores music based on songs, albums, artists, and genre. The basic functionality of this project is that users can insert songs, artists, or albums that are not already in the database, perform basic searches, and update and delete records. For example, a user should be able to find the songs on a particular album, see an error, and correct it. The advanced function will be giving users a playlist based on how much time they want to fill.

## How to run:
```shell
cd FlaskFrontEnd
```
```shell
flask run
```
